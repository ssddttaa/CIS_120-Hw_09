===================
=: Core Concepts :=
===================

- List the four core concepts, the features they implement, and why each feature
 is an appropriate use of the concept. You may copy and paste from your proposal
 document if you did not change the features you are implementing.

  1.2D Array

    - What specific feature of your game will be implemented using this concept?

      The function of this 2D array will be creating a 2D array that will store
      all of the mines. 

    - Why does it make sense to implement this feature with this concept? 
      Justify why this is a non-trivial application of the concept in question.

      This is the most optimal data structure because the game is in the form of
      a grid, and I will constantly need to access a certain mine at a certain 
      location, therefore the constant time access of an array will allow for
      this to be done efficiently in comparison to all other data structures.

=========================
=: Your Implementation :=
=========================

- Provide an overview of each of the classes in your code, and what their
  function is in the overall game.


- Revisit your proposal document. What components of your plan did you end up
  keeping? What did you have to change? Why?


- Were there any significant stumbling blocks while you were implementing your
  game (related to your design, or otherwise)?


- Evaluate your design. Is there a good separation of functionality? How well is
  private state encapsulated? What would you refactor, if given the chance?



========================
=: External Resources :=
========================

- Cite any external resources (libraries, images, tutorials, etc.) that you may
  have used while implementing your game.
